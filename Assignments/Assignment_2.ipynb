    "#### 2. Suppose y, x and u are scalar random variables, with y and x observed but u unobserved. Consider the function h(x) = $x^3$; under standard assumptions this satisfies our concerns about measurability, so E(u|x) = 0 implies E(u$x^3$) = 0. Use this last condition to motivate a simple least squares estimator of the regression equation y = α + βx + u. How does this differ from the usual OLS estimator? Why might one prefer one to the other, and under what conditions?"

    "#### 3. Sometimes we will encounter estimators (e.g., Maximum likelihood) that adopt an assumption of independence, rather than mean independence. In the current setting this might be expressed as something like $Pr(x < x ∩ u < u) = F(x)G(u)$ for some cumulative distribution functions F and G. Show that independence implies mean independence, but not the converse."
