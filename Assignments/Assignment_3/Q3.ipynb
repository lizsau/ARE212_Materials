Using an auxillary regression can show us whether the residuals from the first regression vary with x (heteroskedasticity) or if they are the same across all values of x (no heteroskedasticity). If d is non-zero, there is heteroskedasticty since u^2 varies by x value. Doing a hypothesis test with a null hypothesis of d = 0 tests whether x has an effect on the residuals from the first regression."
